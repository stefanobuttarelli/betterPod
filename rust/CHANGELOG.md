# betterPod Rust: changelog

The separate Rust app for Knulli. A version here whose number is in `Cargo.toml` and has no release yet is published by `.github/workflows/rust.yml`, with its section as the notes.

## v0.2.1 (2026-11-07)

- Quit from the main menu: Y on Settings opens a sheet with **Quit betterPod**, so there is no need to go to the end of Settings (as in betterPod 1.2).

## v0.2.0 (2026-11-07)

The first published build of the separate Rust app for Knulli (Anbernic H700). It is the betterPod 1.1 feature set rewritten in Rust, by Emanuele Macri. betterPod (the Go app) stays as it is, with its own updates.

- Now Playing: the track card keeps its rows while it flips. It turns back in place when you leave it, and Cover Flow opens at the front afterwards.
- The Shuffle / Repeat buttons have their outline; the header shows pause only when paused.
- Software Update has a channel of its own: later versions come through it.
